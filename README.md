## Title
Message Generator

## Description 
After completing the Front-End Engineer Career Path on Codecademy, I started the Full-Stack Engineer path. There is a lot of overlap but there was one JavaScript challenge that was outstanding. In the name of completeness, I completed it, even though it was going back to basics somewhat. However, as it's been a while since I did any pure JavaScript that wasn't part of a React app, it was good to get the refresher of Node!
The file is simple; when it is run, it will generate a random message in the format “Be [adjective]. If you want to [verb phrase], you must [verb phrase].”

## How to use
Make a copy of the file then open the terminal. Type node messageGenerator.js and a random message will be displayed. The message changes each time the programme is run.

## Credits
This was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer career path.
